# 4DOF_Robotic_Manipulator_Trajectory_Avoidance
The goal is to control a planar 4-DOF robotic manipulator to follow a specified trajectory while avoiding a predefined obstacle. The robot's trajectory is parameterized in terms of time, and inverse kinematics is used to compute the necessary joint angles. An animation visualizes the movement of the robot and demonstrates collision avoidance.
